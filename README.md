# TheAgronaut
Agronaut Game

Aboard the Agronaut you need to repair your grandfather's run down agricultural space station. You can earn money by growing crops and selling them to a middle man to send to the Earth. You start with your meager inheritance to purchase seeds and equipment to turn the station back into the flourishing vessel it once was.
